# Data Engineering Projects: EDA, Auto EDA, and Apache Beam

Welcome to my Data Engineering Projects repository! This collection of work showcases my skills and approach to solving real-world data problems using different techniques and tools. The repository contains three distinct projects that demonstrate a range of data engineering tasks, including **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Auto EDA**, and **stream processing with Apache Beam**.

## Overview of Projects

This repository is organized into three major sections, each corresponding to a specific data engineering task:

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis with D3.js Visualizations**
The first project focuses on conducting a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using a complex Kaggle dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, identify trends, and provide insights into the dataset using **interactive D3.js visualizations**. Advanced visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and hierarchical visualizations have been created to visually communicate key insights.

- **Key Focus**: In-depth analysis of the dataset with visually engaging D3.js charts.
- **Tools Used**: Jupyter/Colab, D3.js, Kaggle dataset.

### 2. **Auto EDA using Automated Tools**
In the second project, I used **automated EDA tools** like **Sweetviz** and **pandas-profiling** to generate an in-depth analysis of another Kaggle dataset. This process includes detecting missing values, examining distributions, and identifying correlations. The goal is to present a quick yet comprehensive report with visually appealing charts to summarize the dataset.

- **Key Focus**: Automating the EDA process to save time while ensuring the results are visually intuitive and easy to interpret.
- **Tools Used**: Jupyter/Colab, Sweetviz, pandas-profiling, Kaggle dataset.

### 3. **Apache Beam for Stream Processing**
The third project demonstrates the power of **Apache Beam** for processing real-time streaming data. I created a pipeline to handle large-scale data transformations and processing tasks such as **windowing**, **triggers**, **composite transforms**, and **streaming data operations**. The project also includes a video that explains the working of Apache Beam, the pipeline's flow, and the results achieved.

- **Key Focus**: Hands-on implementation of stream processing using Apache Beam.
- **Tools Used**: Jupyter/Colab, Apache Beam, Python, and streaming data.

## Project Structure

To ensure the project is easy to navigate and well-structured, the repository is divided into folders corresponding to each task. Here is an overview of the directory structure:
