        "This Colab notebook demonstrates the use of Apache Beam for processing movie data. The pipeline includes advanced features like Composite Transforms, ParDo, Windowing, and Triggers. It also simulates streaming data and processes it in real-time, with results saved directly to Google Drive.\n",

        "- **Composite Transforms:** Encapsulate multiple processing steps into reusable components.\n",
        "- **ParDo:** Apply custom logic to individual data elements.\n",
        "- **Windowing and Triggers:** Process streaming data using fixed time windows and triggers.\n",
        "- **Simulated Streaming:** Generate dynamic data streams to mimic real-time processing.\n",

        "2. **Data Parsing:**\n",
        "   - Reads raw CSV lines or generated data and structures them into dictionaries.\n",
        "3. **Windowing and Triggering:**\n",
        "   - Applies fixed 60-second windows and triggers data processing after 30 seconds.\n",
        "4. **Composite Transform:**\n",
        "   - Filters movies and extracts key details (title, country).\n",
        "5. **Formatting:**\n",
        "   - Formats data using a custom ParDo transform for easy readability.\n",
